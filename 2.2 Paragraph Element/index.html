<p>YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her. No... no El, you're not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me.</p>
<p>You’re going to take out the demigorgon with a slingshot? Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon? Why’s he gotta kick the door? You’re pretty cute, you know that?
