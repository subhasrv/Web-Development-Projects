<h1>J. Robert Oppenheimer</h1>

"We knew the world would not be the same.<br/>
A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. <br/>
I remembered the line from the Hindu Scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. <br/> 
Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he
should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says,<br/>
'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' <br/>
I suppose we all thought that, one way or another." <br/>

J. Robert Oppenheimer (22 April 1904 â€“ 18 February 1967) was an American theoretical physicist and the scientific
director of the Manhattan Project, the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. Known as the
"father of the atomic bomb," Oppenheimer's leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's
success. After the war, he became a chief advisor to the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission, where he
advocated for international control of nuclear power and opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. His stance led to
political controversy and the revocation of his security clearance during the Red Scare. Despite this, Oppenheimer is
remembered as one of the most significant figures in 20th-century science and a symbol of the ethical dilemmas posed by
scientific advancement.
